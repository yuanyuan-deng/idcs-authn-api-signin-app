Release Notes - Sample Custom Login Application version 1.1 

Enhancements

1. Terms of Use: the login flow has been enhanced to support IDCS "Terms of Use" feature, where users are required to agree with the terms set forth by IDCS administrator on a per application basis.

2. Access Token Refresh: IDCS added the ability to extend the lifetime of requestState parameter. When that happens, it may not produce the required effect if the access token times out before requestState. Therefore, the login flow has been enhanced to support automatic refresh of access tokens to accommodate requestState extension.

3. Multiple devices per TOTP and Push Factors: the login flow has been enhanced to support the same user account enrolling multiple authenticator applications for TOTP and Push, using the same or different devices.

4. Localizations added: Swedish and French
